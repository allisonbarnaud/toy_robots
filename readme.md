# Toy Robots project

Simulated robots on a 6x6 grid, that can be controlled by input commands (live inputs OR file containing the commands)

Written in: Ruby

Still to do:
- refactor code, better legibility
- Add more comments

To run this code:
1. download toy_robots.rb to your local machine
2. in your CLI, type "ruby toy_robots.rb"
3. A "while" loop allows you to enter the commands indefinitely in your CLI
