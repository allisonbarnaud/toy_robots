# Toy Robots project

Simulated robots on a 6x6 grid, that can be controlled by input commands (live inputs OR file containing the commands)

Written in: Ruby

Progress:
- can read basic input commands from CLI
- can initialize a robot and save details in variables
- can write robot coordinates on a 6x6 board, defined by a 2D array
- can check if robot has been initialized already, checked by name

to do:
- reorganize code to have commands in individual methods
- save each robot's data into hash
- write code for other commands: move, report
- create a check for collision against other robots and edges of board
